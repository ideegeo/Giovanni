{"name":"Giovanni","body":"### Welcome to Giovanni.\r\nGiovanni is a Perl replacement for the idea behind Capistrano. It is a deployment system that can be used comfortably from the commandline to check out code, restart systems and notify.  The system is currently used with git and manages some Catalyst and Mojolicious apps and notifies via Jabber. It supports timestamped rollouts (ie have the last 5 versions of your code on the server and link to the currently running one) and plain git repositories. It tries to detect problems in the deployment process and rolls back. It supports manual rollbacks, two restart modes and does all that without any code on the server. All you need is a working ssh setup with ssh-keys that handle the login.  We also use it with Jenkins to automatically deploy code that successfully completed the test suite.\r\n\r\nGiovanni comes with a commandline tool called gio.\r\n\r\n```\r\n       gio [options] [deploy|rollback|restart]\r\n\r\n        Options:\r\n          --config|c        config file to use\r\n          --offset|o        offset to start from in stage list\r\n          --help|h          brief help message\r\n          --debug|d         turn on debug output\r\n          --man             full documentation\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGiovanni was dreamed up by @norbu09 and has many contributions from @nupfel.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Giovanni?
